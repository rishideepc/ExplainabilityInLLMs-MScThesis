Third-party contributions to the Argumentative LLMs software repository (https://github.com/CLArg-group/argumentative-llms) are also subject to the Contributor Terms published in this repository (https://github.com/CLArg-group/argumentative-llms/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

ARGUMENTATIVE LLMS ACADEMIC PUBLIC LICENSE

Preamble

    This license contains the terms and conditions of using Argumentative LLMs software in noncommercial settings: at academic institutions for teaching and research use, and at non-profit research organizations. You will find that this license provides noncommercial users of Argumentative LLMs software with rights that are similar to the well-known GNU Affero General Public License, while prohibiting its use in commercial settings. In fact, if you intend to use Argumentative LLMs in a “for-profit” environment, where research is conducted to develop or enhance a product, is used in a commercial service offering, or when a commercial company uses Argumentative LLMs to participate in a research project, then you need to obtain a commercial license for Argumentative LLMs. In that case, please contact the copyright holders to inquire about commercial licenses.
 
    The precise terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
Definitions

“Copyright Holders” means the authors of the "Argumentative Large Language Models for Explainable and Contestable Claim Verification" paper.

“Program” means a copy of Argumentative LLMs software, which is said to be distributed under this Argumentative LLMs Academic Public License.

“Work based on the Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. It also includes any code or work that directly interfaces with the Program through function calls or similar programmatic means. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.)

“Using the Program” means any act of creating executables that contain or directly use libraries that are part of the Program, running any of the tools and components that are part of the Program, creating works based on the Program, or distributing such works.

“Server-side Use” means making the Program, or any Work based on the Program, available for use or access by others over a network, regardless of whether users interact with the Program directly or indirectly. This includes, but is not limited to, cases where the Program is used as part of a service, chain of services, or infrastructure—whether as a standalone component, integrated into a larger system, or indirectly accessible via intermediary APIs, microservices, or other layers of abstraction. For the purposes of this License, Server-side Use shall be treated as a form of distribution.

Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

§1. Permission is hereby granted to use the Program free of charge for any noncommercial purpose, including teaching and research at universities, colleges and other educational institutions, research at non-profit research institutions, and personal non-profit purposes. For using the Program for commercial purposes, including but not restricted to consulting activities, design of commercial hardware or software networking products, a commercial entity participating in research projects, and any activity where the Program or its derivatives is used to directly or indirectly support for-profit activities, you have to contact the Author for an appropriate license.

§2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that the use complies with the non-commercial restrictions outlined in Section 1, and that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

§3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work, provided that such activities are conducted for non-commercial purposes as defined in Section 1 and cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not based on the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose regulations for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. (If the same, independent sections are distributed as part of a package that is otherwise reliant on, or is based on the Program, then the distribution of the whole package, including but not restricted to the independent section, must be on the unmodified terms of this License, regadless of who the author of the included sections was.)

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based or reliant on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

§4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 3) in code or executable form under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, free of charge, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

For the purposes of this License, Server-side Use of the Program, or any Work based on the Program, shall be considered a form of distribution and subject to the same terms and conditions as physical or digital distribution outlined in Sections 2 through 4. This includes the obligation to provide the corresponding source code as defined in Section 4.

§5. You may not use, copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any breach of the terms of this License automatically terminates your rights under this License without notice. Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use, modification, and distribution of the Program and any works based on it. However, third parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License, in compliance with its terms, shall not have their licenses terminated provided they remain in full compliance. Note that the rights granted under this License, including those related to copying, modifying, and distributing the Program as described in Sections 2 through 4, are strictly limited to non-commercial purposes as defined in Section 1. Any use of the Program for commercial purposes is expressly prohibited without obtaining a separate commercial license. 

§6. You are not required to formally accept this License. However, nothing in this License grants you permission to modify, use (including Server-side Use), or distribute the Program or any derivative works unless you comply with its terms. If you modify, use, or distribute the Program (or any work based on it), you are indicating your acceptance of this License and its terms. By performing these actions, you agree to abide by all the conditions stated herein, including the restrictions on commercial use and redistribution outlined in Sections 1 through 5.

§7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

§8. If you face conflicting obligations—whether due to a court judgment, administrative order, allegation of patent infringement, or any other legal or contractual reason—that make it impossible for you to meet the conditions of this License, you may not use or distribute the Program or any derivative works. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

§9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program are restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

§10. If any provision of this License, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by court or other authority, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this License, and their application to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected. The invalid provision shall be replaced with a valid provision that comes as close as possible to the original intent and purpose of the invalid provision.

NO WARRANTY

§11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

§12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED ON IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
