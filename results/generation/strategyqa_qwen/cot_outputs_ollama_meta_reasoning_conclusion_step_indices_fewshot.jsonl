If the vocal cords are held open by a constriction such as a thyroid lobe, then the vocal cords will vibrate faster when air pressure increases.\n\nThis is why some people believe that they sound deeper when their thyroid gland is enlarged (hypothyroidism).\n\nHowever, this is not actually true because the actual cause of the increased vocal cord vibration is not actually related to the size of the thyroid gland.\n\nIn fact, it turns out that the actual cause of the increased vocal cord vibration is actually related to a constriction in the larynx known as the glottis.\n\nWhen air pressure increases in the throat and the glottis is open, then the vocal cords will vibrate faster when air pressure increases.\n\nOn the other hand, when air pressure decreases in the throat and the glottis is closed, then the vocal cords will vibrate slower when air pressure decreases.\n\nTherefore, the actual cause of the increased vocal cord vibration when the thyroid gland is enlarged (hypothyroidism))"}
