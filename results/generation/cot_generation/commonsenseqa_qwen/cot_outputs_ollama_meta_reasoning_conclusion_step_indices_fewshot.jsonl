Control surfaces include flaps, slats, and ailerons. These surfaces help pilots manage the angle of attack (AoA) and pitch attitude.\n\n3. Impact upon stability: Engine failures can also have significant impacts upon aircraft stability. Stability refers to an aircraft's ability to maintain its position in space when subjected to external forces such as wind or gravity.\n\n4. Impact upon fuel consumption: Engine failures can also have significant impacts upon aircraft fuel consumption. Fuel consumption refers to the amount of fuel (e.g., gasoline) that is consumed by an aircraft during a specific flight segment. High fuel consumption indicates that an aircraft may be consuming more fuel than it should during its flight segments.\n\n5.
