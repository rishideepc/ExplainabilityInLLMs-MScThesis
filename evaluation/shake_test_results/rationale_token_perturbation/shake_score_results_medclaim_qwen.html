However, if the conclusion that initial ultrasonography led to earlier detection of nephrolithiasis and resulted in lower cumulative radiation exposure were due to a measurement bias, it would exemplify measurement bias. Measurement bias occurs when the measurements or evaluations made during the study are systematically biased due to the methods used for their acquisition, such as the choice of imaging method.</td>
